# c0: Web Components built with [Zero](https://github.com/raystubbs/zero)
There's not much here yet, but I'll be adding to it as time permits.  The
purpose of the library is twofold:

1. Provide some examples of how to build components with Zero
2. Provide some nice, ready made components that follow a common design system

Use the following to launch a [Portfolio](https://github.com/cjohansen/portfolio) of
the available components at <http://localhost:8000>.

```shell
npx shadow-cljs watch portfolio
```
